The AGILE PhD school aims to bring PhD students from different countries together. The purpose of the school is to offer a platform for PhD students to present their research to date, exchange ideas, learn and discuss geospatial methods and acquire and improve skills related to geoinformatics. This will allow participants to:

-   be exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our domain\
-   exchange ideas about the PhD process itself\
-   develop their own network
-   be exposed to the reproducibility and reproducibility practices in Geoscience and GIScience.
