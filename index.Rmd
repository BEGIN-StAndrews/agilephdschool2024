November 27th to 29th, 2024, at the Universitat Jaume I, Castellón (Spain)

The AGILE PhD school is designed to connect PhD students from various countries. Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase their research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on geospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills. 

Participation in the school will enable attendees to:

-   Be exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our domain
-   Exchange ideas about the PhD process itself\
-   Develop their network
-   Be exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.
