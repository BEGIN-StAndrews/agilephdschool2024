**November 27th to 29th 2024,** at the **Universitat Jaume I, Castellón
de la Plana** (Spain)

The AGILE PhD school is designed to connect PhD students from various
countries. Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase
their research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on
geospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills.

Participation in the school will enable attendees to:

-   Be exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our
    domain
-   Exchange ideas about the PhD process itself
-   Develop their network
-   Be exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.

## Why to participate?

Attending the AGILE PhD School offers a great opportunity for PhD
students within the European GIScience community. Ideally for PhD
students in their second year or nearing their dissertation. The school
aims to foster strong community academic connections, where participants
will benefit from valuable insights shared by former AGILE PhD School
alumni.

On this ocasion, we have prepared an agenda to not only enhance
students' scientific writing skills but also deepen their understanding
of GeoAI research. The AGILE PhD school provides a platform for the
students to amplify the impact of their ongoing research through direct
engagement with the AGILE community, get new ideas, seek feedback about
current preliminary results and share experience about the PhD journey.

## Where will take place?

The 7th edition of the AGILE PhD school will take place in Castellón de
la Plana, Spain. Situated between the beautiful Mediterranean Sea and
the stunning Sierra de Espadán mountains. The school will be hosted at
the University Jaume I, by the support of the [Geospatial Research
Group - GeoTec](https://geotec.uji.es/). Submit your abstract and apply
to be part of this AGILE PhD School edition.

## How to apply

To join the AGILE PhD School 2024, prospective participants are required
to submit a 300 to 500-word abstract summarizing their current research.
This abstract may include preliminary results and highlight the
relevance of your work to the main topic of the AGILE PhD School: GeoAI
for the Social Good.

-   Submit your abstract to:
    [Fernando.Benitez\@st-andrews.ac.uk](mailto:Fernando.Benitez@st-andrews.ac.u).
-   Submission Deadline: August 27, 2024

Your submission will be evaluated based on the clarity of your research,
the significance of your preleminary findings, and their potential
impact on the field of GeoAI. We look forward to receiving your
abstracts and welcoming you to an enriching academic experience.
