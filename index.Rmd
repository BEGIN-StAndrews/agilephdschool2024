**November 27th to 29th 2024,** at the **Universitat Jaume I, Castellón
de la Plana** (Spain)

The AGILE PhD school is designed to connect PhD students from various
countries. Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase
their research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on
geospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills.

Participation in the school will enable attendees to:

-   Be exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our
    domain
-   Exchange ideas about the PhD process itself
-   Develop their network
-   Be exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.

## Why to participate?

Attending the AGILE PhD School offers a great opportunity for PhD
students within the European GIScience community. Ideally for PhD
students in their second year or nearing their dissertation. The school
aims to foster strong community academic connections, where participants
will benefit from valuable insights shared by former AGILE PhD School
alumni.

We have prepared an agenda to not only enhance students' scientific
writing skills but also deepen their understanding of GeoAI research.
The AGILE PhD school provides a platform for the students to amplify the
impact of their ongoing research through direct engagement with the
AGILE community, get new ideas, and seek feedback about current
preliminary results and share experiences about the PhD journey.

## Where will it take place?

For the second time, the AGILE PhD school will be held in Castellon, which is situated between the beautiful Mediterranean Sea and the stunning Sierra de Espadán mountains. The 7th Edition of the school will be hosted at the University Jaume I, with the support of the [Geospatial Research Group— GeoTec](https://geotec.uji.es/). Castellon is conveniently located between Valencia and Barcelona.

    <h3>Mobility Data Science in the Age of AI</h3>
    <p> "A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must never make a management decision." (IBM 1979)
    </p>
    <p> The current AI hype, driven by generative AI and particularly large language models (LLMs), is creating excitement, fear, and inflated expectations. In this talk, I will argue that to transform this hype into sustainable and positive development, we need to find ways to empower people to take control of their own assistive AI technology. To achieve this, spatial data science in general, and mobility data science in particular, must up their game and embrace open-source development and collaboration.
    </p>
</div>

```


-   10:00 - 11:00 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming:
    Participants should form groups to brainstorm potential research
    questions or projects using Geo AI and open-source tools, guided by
    the insights from the keynote.

Each group selects one research proposal/idea and outlines how to
enhance it using the tools and methods discussed. Outcome required:
Develop a preliminary outline or draft of a potential journal paper,
highlighting the problem, Research Question, methodology, and expected
outcomes.

<div style="border: 1px solid #ccc; padding: 10px; border-radius: 8px; max-width: 800px; margin: auto; font-family: Arial, sans-serif;">
    <h3>Participatory Urban Analytics for Inclusive Data Innovations and Artificial Intelligence: Enabling Transformative Public Policy</h3>
    
    <p> Data innovations and Artificial Intelligence have the potential to support cities in addressing the most pressing challenges posed by the current triple planetary emergency and its climate, ecology, and social inequality dimensions. However, solutions built upon biased or partial data will not address the required challenges, since they may systematically misrepresent the realities of the most vulnerable communities. To overcome this, the talk introduces an approach to participatory urban analytics which bridges citizen participation and data science to address inequalities in data and society. Results from this approach show significant social impacts in the context of resilience to flood and landslide disasters in Latin American disadvantaged communities (the Waterproofing Data and URBE Latam projects) and the improvement of access to urban infrastructure and services in informal settlements in Kenya and Nigeria (IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem project).

    <h3>Open Science and Reproducibility</h3>
    
    <p>Reproducibility is a cornerstone of reliable research, allowing others to validate findings by following the same methods and data to achieve similar results. This talk will introduce the current landscape of open science and reproducibility within the field of GIScience. Specifically, it will guide doctoral students through the Agile Reproducibility Guidelines and essential resources to enhance the reproducibility of their own work. Additionally, it will introduce The Turing Way—a project, handbook, and community dedicated to reproducible, ethical, and collaborative data science.

-   11:30 - 13:00: Final Presentation and Feedback Session:

Based on the previous brainstorming sessions, and the progress with the
drafted ideas, groups should prepare a brief presentation (max 3 slide)
of their enhanced research proposal or draft journal paper, emphasizing
the use or integration of keynote speakers' tools, methods or ideas.

-   13:00 - 13:30 - Closing remarks
