November 27th to 29th 2024, at the Universitat Jaume I, Castellón de la
Plana (Spain)

The AGILE PhD school is designed to connect PhD students from various
countries. Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase
their research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on
geospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills.

Participation in the school will enable attendees to:

-   Be exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our
    domain
-   Exchange ideas about the PhD process itself
-   Develop their network
-   Be exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.

## Why to participate?

Attending the AGILE PhD School offers a great opportunity for PhD students within the European GIScience community. Ideally for PhD students in their second year or nearing their dissertation. The school aims to foster strong community academic connections, where participants will benefit from valuable insights shared by former AGILE PhD School alumni. 

In this ocasion, we have prepared an agenda to not only enhance students' scientific writing skills but also deepen their understanding of GeoAI research. The AGILE PhD school provides a platform for the students to amplify the impact of their ongoing research through direct engagement with the AGILE community, get new ideas, seek feedback about current preliminary results and share experience about the PhD journey.

## Where will take place?

The 7th edition of the AGILE PhD school will take place in Castellón de la Plana, Spain. Situated between the beautiful Mediterranean Sea and the stunning Sierra de Espadán mountains, Castellón provides an inspiring backdrop for any academic retreat. Come and experience Spanish hospitality, delicious cuisine, and vibrant local culture while collaborating with fellow researchers.
