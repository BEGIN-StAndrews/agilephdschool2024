**November 27th to 29th 2024,** at the **Universitat Jaume I, Castellón
de la Plana** (Spain)

The AGILE PhD school is designed to connect PhD students from various
countries. Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase
their research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on
geospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills.

Participation in the school will enable attendees to:

-   Be exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our
    domain
-   Exchange ideas about the PhD process itself
-   Develop their network
-   Be exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.

## Why to participate?

Attending the AGILE PhD School offers a great opportunity for PhD
students within the European GIScience community. Ideally for PhD
students in their second year or nearing their dissertation. The school
aims to foster strong community academic connections, where participants
will benefit from valuable insights shared by former AGILE PhD School
alumni.

We have prepared an agenda to not only enhance students' scientific
writing skills but also deepen their understanding of GeoAI research.
The AGILE PhD school provides a platform for the students to amplify the
impact of their ongoing research through direct engagement with the
AGILE community, get new ideas, and seek feedback about current
preliminary results and share experiences about the PhD journey.

## Where will it take place?

The 7th edition of the AGILE PhD school will take place in Castellón de
la Plana, Spain. Situated between the beautiful Mediterranean Sea and
the stunning Sierra de Espadán mountains. The school will be hosted at
the University Jaume I, with the support of the [Geospatial Research
Group - GeoTec](https://geotec.uji.es/). Submit your abstract and apply
to be part of this AGILE PhD School edition.

## How to apply

To join the AGILE PhD School 2024, participants are required to submit a
300 to 500-word abstract summarising their ongoing research. The
abstract may include preliminary results and highlight the relevance of
your work to the main topic of the AGILE PhD School: GeoAI for the
Social Good.

-   Submit your abstract to:
    [Fernando.Benitez\@st-andrews.ac.uk](mailto:Fernando.Benitez@st-andrews.ac.uk).
-   Submission Deadline: ~~**August 27, 2024**~~

Your submission will be evaluated based on the clarity of your research,
the significance of your preliminary findings, and their potential
impact on the field of GeoAI.

### Formatting instructions

Abstracts must be prepared using either the Word Document template or
the LaTeX Document template provided at
<https://www.agile-giscience-series.net/agile-giss-templates.html>.
Abstracts must be written in English according to the formatting
guidelines. Note: Latex recommended editor: Overleaf.

### Financial support

Financial assistance is available to the selected participants. While we
wish we could cover all the related expenses, our budget is limited, and

    | A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer    |
    | must never make a management decision.” (IBM 1979)                |
    |                                                                   |
    | The current AI hype, driven by generative AI and particularly     |
    | large language models (LLMs), is creating excitement, fear, and   |
    | inflated expectations. In this talk, I will argue that to         |
    | transform this hype into sustainable and positive development, we |
    | need to find ways to empower people to take control of their own  |
    | assistive AI technology. To achieve this, spatial data science in |
    | general, and mobility data science in particular, must up their   |
    | game and embrace open-source development and collaboration.       |
    +-------------------------------------------------------------------+
