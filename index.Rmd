**November 27th to 29th 2024,** at the **Universitat Jaume I, Castellón
de la Plana** (Spain)

The AGILE PhD school is designed to connect PhD students from various
countries. Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase
their research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on
geospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills.

Participation in the school will enable attendees to:

-   Be exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our
    domain
-   Exchange ideas about the PhD process itself
-   Develop their network
-   Be exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.

## Why to participate?

Attending the AGILE PhD School offers a great opportunity for PhD
students within the European GIScience community. Ideally for PhD
students in their second year or nearing their dissertation. The school
aims to foster strong community academic connections, where participants
will benefit from valuable insights shared by former AGILE PhD School
alumni.

We have prepared an agenda to not only enhance students' scientific
writing skills but also deepen their understanding of GeoAI research.
The AGILE PhD school provides a platform for the students to amplify the
impact of their ongoing research through direct engagement with the
AGILE community, get new ideas, and seek feedback about current
preliminary results and share experiences about the PhD journey.

## Where will it take place?

The 7th edition of the AGILE PhD school will take place in Castellón de
la Plana, Spain. Situated between the beautiful Mediterranean Sea and
the stunning Sierra de Espadán mountains. The school will be hosted at
the University Jaume I, with the support of the [Geospatial Research
Group - GeoTec](https://geotec.uji.es/). Submit your abstract and apply
to be part of this AGILE PhD School edition.

    Graser](https://anitagraser.com/) ( [Austrian Institute of
    Technology](http://www.ait.ac.at/) in Vienna):

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ### Mobility Data Science in the Age of AI.                           |
    |                                                                       |
    | A computer can never be held accountable, therefore a computer must   |
    | never make a management decision.” (IBM 1979)                         |
    |                                                                       |
    | The current AI hype, driven by generative AI and particularly large   |
    | language models (LLMs), is creating excitement, fear, and inflated    |
    | expectations. In this talk, I will argue that to transform this hype  |
    | into sustainable and positive development, we need to find ways to    |
    | empower people to take control of their own assistive AI technology.  |
    | To achieve this, spatial data science in general, and mobility data   |
    | science in particular, must up their game and embrace open-source     |
    | development and collaboration.                                        |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

-   10:00 - 11:00 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming:
    Participants should form groups to brainstorm potential research
    questions or projects using Geo AI and open-source tools, guided by
    the insights from the keynote.

Each group selects one research proposal/idea and outlines how to
enhance it using the tools and methods discussed. Outcome required:
Develop a preliminary outline or draft of a potential journal paper,
highlighting the problem, Research Question, methodology, and expected
outcomes.

-   Coffee break

-   11:30 - 13:30 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming,

-   Lunch at *Restaurante Agora* in campus

**Afternoon session**

-   15:00 - 16:00 - [Prof. Joao Porto de Albuquerque -
    Professor in Urban Analytics (Urban Studies & Social Policy)
    University of
    Glasgow](https://www.gla.ac.uk/schools/socialpolitical/staff/joaoportodealbuquerque/)

    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+
    | ### Participatory Urban Analytics for Inclusive Data                  |
    | ### Innovations and Artificial Intelligence: Enabling                 |
    | ### Transformative Public Policy                                      |
    |                                                                       |
    | Data innovations and Artificial Intelligence have the potential to    |
    | support cities in addressing the most pressing challenges posed by    |
    | the current triple planetary emergency and its climate, ecology and   |
    | social inequality dimensions. However, solutions built upon biased or |
    | partial data will not address the required challenges, since they may |
    | systematically misrepresent the realities of the most vulnerable      |
    | communities. To overcome this, the talk introduces an approach        |
    | to participatory urban analytics which bridges citizen participation  |
    | and data science to address inequalities in data and society. Results |
    | from this approach show significant social impacts in the context of  |
    | resilience to flood and landslide disasters in Latin American         |
    | disadvantaged communities (the Waterproofing Data and URBE Latam      |
    | projects) and the improvement of access to urban infrastructure and   |
    | services in informal settlements in Kenya and Nigeria (IDEAMAPS Data  |
    | Ecosystem project).                                                   |
    +-----------------------------------------------------------------------+

-   16:00 - 18:00 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming:
    Continuation of the morning brainstorming and drafting the paper
    idea based on the keynote speakers tools, methods and suggestions.

-   20:00 - Dinner: TBD

the use or integration of keynote speakers' tools, methods or ideas.
