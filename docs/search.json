Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase\ntheir research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on\ngeospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills.\nParticipation in the school will enable attendees to:\nBe exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our\ndomain\nExchange ideas about the PhD process itself\nDevelop their network\nBe exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.\nWhy to participate?\nAttending the AGILE PhD School offers a great opportunity for PhD students within the European GIScience community. Ideally for PhD students in their second year or nearing their dissertation. The school aims to foster strong community academic connections, where participants will benefit from valuable insights shared by former AGILE PhD School alumni.\nIn this ocasion, we have prepared an agenda to not only enhance students’ scientific writing skills but also deepen their understanding of GeoAI research. The AGILE PhD school provides a platform for the students to amplify the impact of their ongoing research through direct engagement with the AGILE community, get new ideas, seek feedback about current preliminary results and share experience about the PhD journey.\nWhere will take place?\nThe 7th edition of the AGILE PhD school will take place in Castellón de la Plana, Spain. Situated between the beautiful Mediterranean Sea and the stunning Sierra de Espadán mountains, Castellón provides an inspiring backdrop for any academic retreat. Come and experience Spanish hospitality, delicious cuisine, and vibrant local culture while collaborating with fellow researchers.\n\nProgramme.\nNote: timetable is indicative.
