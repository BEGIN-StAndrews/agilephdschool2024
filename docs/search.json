Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase\ntheir research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on\ngeospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills.\nParticipation in the school will enable attendees to:\nBe exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our\ndomain\nExchange ideas about the PhD process itself\nDevelop their network\nBe exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.\nSlides and Shared Material\n\n\n  Keynote Speakers\n  Organisers\n  PhD Candidates\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPictures\n\n  \n\n\nWhy to participate?\nAttending the AGILE PhD School offers a great opportunity for PhD\nstudents within the European GIScience community. Ideally for PhD\nstudents in their second year or nearing their dissertation. The school\naims to foster strong community academic connections, where participants\nwill benefit from valuable insights shared by former AGILE PhD School\nalumni.\nWe have prepared an agenda to not only enhance students’ scientific\nwriting skills but also deepen their understanding of GeoAI research.\nThe AGILE PhD school provides a platform for the students to amplify the\nimpact of their ongoing research through direct engagement with the\nAGILE community, get new ideas, and seek feedback about current\npreliminary results and share experiences about the PhD journey.\nWhere will it take place?\nFor the second time, the AGILE PhD school will be held in Castellon, which is situated between the beautiful Mediterranean Sea and the stunning Sierra de Espadán mountains. The 7th Edition of the school will be hosted at the University Jaume I, with the support of the Geospatial Research Group— GeoTec. Castellon is conveniently located between Valencia and Barcelona.\niFrames are not supported on this page.\nKeynote Speakers\nAnita Graser\n\n    \n        \n            Is a spatial data scientist, open source GIS advocate, and author with a background in geographic information science. \n            She is currently Senior Scientist at AIT - The Austrian Institute of Technology in Vienna. She serves on the QGIS project \n            steering committee and has published several books about QGIS. Furthermore, she develops tools, such as the popular \n            MovingPandas. Her contributions include developing QGIS plugins, writing user-friendly tutorials, and authoring books \n            such as \"Learning QGIS\" and \"QGIS Map Design.\" Anita also runs a widely-followed blog, \n            Free and Open Source GIS Ramblings, where she shares insights \n            and tutorials on open-source GIS solutions.\n        \n    \n\nProf. João Porto de Albuquerque\n\n    \n        \n            Is Professor in Urban Analytics at Urban Studies in the School of Social and Political Sciences at the University \n            of Glasgow and Deputy Director of the Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC), \n            where he leads the \n            \"\n            Urban Sustainability and Participation\" theme. Professor Porto de Albuquerque is a geographer and computer scientist \n            with an interdisciplinary background who conducts research on geographic information and urban sustainability, focusing \n            on addressing inequalities in data and society. His work cuts across the borders between social and computing sciences, \n            as well as between the global South and the global North. His pioneering and award-winning approach to \n            participatory urban analytics combines participatory methods (e.g., citizen science, participatory GIS, \n            action research, participatory software design) and geo-computational data science.\n        \n    \n\n\nRafael Verduzco Torres\n\n    \n        \n            Rafael is a Lecturer in Urban Analytics at the Division of Urban Studies and Social Policy. His work centres on the examination and potential applications of emerging forms of data and innovative methodologies to address urban mobility and transport research questions. He is particularly interested in the interactions between spatial accessibility, the urban economy, and social equity. Rafael contributes to teaching in the Urban Analytics and Urban Transport programmes and is also a member of the Urban Big Data Centre (UBDC), where he often collaborates with the Data Service in the development and curation of various datasets.\n        \n    \n\nSelected Candidates\nGet to know the 2024 PhD candidates who have been selected, find out their background, which AGILE institutions they are currently affiliated with, and most importantly, their research topics.\n\nProgramme\nLast Update: 25 Nov, 14:00 - Details in progress\nMeeting room\nThe PhD school will take place at the University Jaume I, in the Building called: “Investigació II” –> Level 0 - NB0003CC meeting room.

In this talk, I will argue that to transform this hype into sustainable and positive development, we need to find ways to empower people to take control of their own assistive AI technology. To achieve this, spatial data science in general, and mobility data science in particular, must up their game and embrace open-source development and collaboration.\n    \n\n\n10:00 - 11:00 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming:\nParticipants should form groups to brainstorm potential research\nquestions or projects using Geo AI and open-source tools, guided by\nthe insights from the keynote.\nEach group selects one research proposal/idea and outlines how to\nenhance it using the tools and methods discussed. Outcome required:\nDevelop a preliminary outline or draft of a potential journal paper,\nhighlighting the problem, Research Question, methodology, and expected\noutcomes.\nCoffee break\n11:30 - 13:30 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming,\nLunch at Restaurante Agora in campus\nAfternoon session\n15:00 - 16:00 - Prof. Joao Porto de Albuquerque -\nProfessor in Urban Analytics (Urban Studies & Social Policy)\nUniversity of\nGlasgow\n\n    Participatory Urban Analytics for Inclusive Data Innovations and Artificial Intelligence: Enabling Transformative Public Policy\n    \n     Data innovations and Artificial Intelligence have the potential to support cities in addressing the most pressing challenges posed by the current triple planetary emergency and its climate, ecology, and social inequality dimensions. However, solutions built upon biased or partial data will not address the required challenges, since they may systematically misrepresent the realities of the most vulnerable communities. To overcome this, the talk introduces an approach to participatory urban analytics which bridges citizen participation and data science to address inequalities in data and society. Results from this approach show significant social impacts in the context of resilience to flood and landslide disasters in Latin American disadvantaged communities (the Waterproofing Data and URBE Latam projects) and the improvement of access to urban infrastructure and services in informal settlements in Kenya and Nigeria (IDEAMAPS Data Ecosystem project).\n    \n\n16:00 - 18:00 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming:\nContinuation of the morning brainstorming and drafting the paper\nidea based on the keynote speakers tools, methods and suggestions.\n20:00 - N/A - Social Dinner: Restaurant La Tagliatella\nAddress: C/ Lagasca, esquina Prim 9, 12003, Castellón de la Plana, Spain -\nGM Location: https://www.google.com/maps/place/39.9837973,-0.0303198\niFrames are not supported on this page.\nDay 4: Final presentations and closing remarks\nFriday, November 29th 2024\nFacilitators: Alina Ristea,\nHoda Bakhshi,\nDiego\nPajarito,\nFernando Benitez-Paez\nMeeting room: NB0003CC\nroom,\nEdificio de Investigación II, NB, Universitat Jaume I\nMorning session\n10:00 - 11:00 - Dr. Rafael Verduzco-Torres -\nLecturer in Urban Analytics, University of\nGlasgow\n\n    Open Science and Reproducibility\n    \n    Reproducibility is a cornerstone of reliable research, allowing others to validate findings by following the same methods and data to achieve similar results. This talk will introduce the current landscape of open science and reproducibility within the field of GIScience. Specifically, it will guide doctoral students through the Agile Reproducibility Guidelines and essential resources to enhance the reproducibility of their own work. Additionally, it will introduce The Turing Way—a project, handbook, and community dedicated to reproducible, ethical, and collaborative data science.\n    \n\n11:30 - 13:00: Final Presentation and Feedback Session:\nBased on the previous brainstorming sessions, and the progress with the\ndrafted ideas, groups should prepare a brief presentation (max 3 slide)\nof their enhanced research proposal or draft journal paper, emphasizing\nthe use or integration of keynote speakers’ tools, methods or ideas.\n13:00 - 13:30 - Closing remarks\nLunch at Restaurante Agora in campus\nHow to apply\n\nThe call to submit abstract has finished and the candidates were\nalready selected, please keep an eye on the next AGILE PhD School.\n\nTo join the AGILE PhD School 2024, participants are required to submit a\n300 to 500-word abstract summarising their ongoing research.
