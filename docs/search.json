Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase\ntheir research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on\ngeospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills.\nParticipation in the school will enable attendees to:\nBe exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our\ndomain\nExchange ideas about the PhD process itself\nDevelop their network\nBe exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.\nWhy to participate?\nAttending the AGILE PhD School offers a great opportunity for PhD\nstudents within the European GIScience community. Ideally for PhD\nstudents in their second year or nearing their dissertation. The school\naims to foster strong community academic connections, where participants\nwill benefit from valuable insights shared by former AGILE PhD School\nalumni.\nWe have prepared an agenda to not only enhance students’ scientific\nwriting skills but also deepen their understanding of GeoAI research.\nThe AGILE PhD school provides a platform for the students to amplify the\nimpact of their ongoing research through direct engagement with the\nAGILE community, get new ideas, and seek feedback about current\npreliminary results and share experiences about the PhD journey.\nWhere will it take place?\nThe 7th edition of the AGILE PhD school will take place in Castellón de\nla Plana, Spain. Situated between the beautiful Mediterranean Sea and\nthe stunning Sierra de Espadán mountains. The school will be hosted at\nthe University Jaume I, with the support of the Geospatial Research\nGroup - GeoTec. Submit your abstract and apply\nto be part of this AGILE PhD School edition.\n\nKeynote Speakers\nAnita Graser\n\n\nIs a spatial data scientist, open source\nGIS advocate, and author with a\nbackground in geographic information\nscience. She is currently Senior\nScientist at AIT - The Austrian Institute\nof Technology in Vienna. She serves on\nthe QGIS project steering committee and\nhas published several books about QGIS.\nFurthermore, she develops tools, such as\nthe popular MovingPandas. Her\ncontributions include developing QGIS\nplugins, writing user-friendly tutorials,\nand authoring books such as “Learning\nQGIS” and “QGIS Map Design.” Anita also\nruns a widely-followed blog, Free and\nOpen Source GIS Rambl\nings, where\nshe shares insights and tutorials on\nopen-source GIS solutions.\nProf. João Porto de Albuquerque\n\n\nIs Professor in Urban Analytics at Urban\nStudies in the School of Social and\nPolitical Sciences at the University\nof Glasgow and Deputy Director of the\nUrban Big Data Centre (\nUBDC), where he\nleads the “Urban Sustainability and\nPartic\nipation”\ntheme. Professor Porto de Albuquerque is\na geographer and computer scientist with\nan interdisciplinary background who\nconducts research on geographic\ninformation and urban sustainability,\nfocusing on addressing inequalities in\ndata and society. His work cuts across\nthe borders between social and computing\nsciences, as well as between the global\nSouth and the global North. His\npioneering and award-winning approach\nto participatory urban analytics\ncombines participatory methods (e.g.,\ncitizen science, participatory GIS,\naction research, participatory software\ndesign) and geo-computational data\nscience.\nSelected Candidates\n\nProgramme\nNote: the timetable is indicative.

In this talk, I will argue that to transform this hype\ninto sustainable and positive development, we need to find ways to\nempower people to take control of their own assistive AI technology.\nTo achieve this, spatial data science in general, and mobility data\nscience in particular, must up their game and embrace open-source\ndevelopment and collaboration.\n\n10:00 - 11:00 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming:\nParticipants should form groups to brainstorm potential research\nquestions or projects using Geo AI and open-source tools, guided by\nthe insights from the keynote.\nEach group selects one research proposal/idea and outlines how to\nenhance it using the tools and methods discussed. Outcome required:\nDevelop a preliminary outline or draft of a potential journal paper,\nhighlighting the problem, Research Question, methodology, and expected\noutcomes.\nCoffee break\n11:30 - 13:30 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming,\nLunch at Restaurante Agora in campus\nAfternoon session\n15:00 - 16:00 - Prof. Joao Porto de Albuquerque -\nProfessor in Urban Analytics (Urban Studies & Social Policy)\nUniversity of\nGlasgow\nParticipatory Urban Analytics for Inclusive Data\nInnovations and Artificial Intelligence: Enabling\nTransformative Public Policy\nData innovations and Artificial Intelligence have the potential to\nsupport cities in addressing the most pressing challenges posed by\nthe current triple planetary emergency and its climate, ecology and\nsocial inequality dimensions. However, solutions built upon biased or\npartial data will not address the required challenges, since they may\nsystematically misrepresent the realities of the most vulnerable\ncommunities. To overcome this, the talk introduces an approach\nto participatory urban analytics which bridges citizen participation\nand data science to address inequalities in data and society. Results\nfrom this approach show significant social impacts in the context of\nresilience to flood and landslide disasters in Latin American\ndisadvantaged communities (the Waterproofing Data and URBE Latam\nprojects) and the improvement of access to urban infrastructure and\nservices in informal settlements in Kenya and Nigeria (IDEAMAPS Data\nEcosystem project).\n\n16:00 - 18:00 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming:\nContinuation of the morning brainstorming and drafting the paper\nidea based on the keynote speakers tools, methods and suggestions.\n20:00 - Dinner: TBD\nDay 4: Final presentations and closing remarks\nFriday, November 29th 2024\nFacilitators: Alina Ristea,\nHoda Bakhshi,\nDiego\nPajarito,\nFernando Benitez-Paez\nMeeting room: NB0003CC\nroom,\nEdificio de Investigación II, NB, Universitat Jaume I\nMorning session\n10:00 - 11:00 Open Science and Reproducibility – The Turing Way\nCoffee break\n11:30 - 13:00: Final Presentation and Feedback Session:\nBased on the previous brainstorming sessions, and the progress with the\ndrafted ideas, groups should prepare a brief presentation (max 3 slide)\nof their enhanced research proposal or draft journal paper, emphasizing\nthe use or integration of keynote speakers’ tools, methods or ideas.\n13:00 - 13:30 - Closing remarks\nLunch at Restaurante Agora in campus\nHow to apply\n\nThe call to submit abstract has finished and the candidates were\nalready selected, please keep an eye on the next AGILE PhD School.\n\nTo join the AGILE PhD School 2024, participants are required to submit a\n300 to 500-word abstract summarising their ongoing research.
