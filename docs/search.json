Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase\ntheir research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on\ngeospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills.\nParticipation in the school will enable attendees to:\nBe exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our\ndomain\nExchange ideas about the PhD process itself\nDevelop their network\nBe exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.\nWhy to participate?\nAttending the AGILE PhD School offers a great opportunity for PhD\nstudents within the European GIScience community. Ideally for PhD\nstudents in their second year or nearing their dissertation. The school\naims to foster strong community academic connections, where participants\nwill benefit from valuable insights shared by former AGILE PhD School\nalumni.\nOn this ocasion, we have prepared an agenda to not only enhance\nstudents’ scientific writing skills but also deepen their understanding\nof GeoAI research. The AGILE PhD school provides a platform for the\nstudents to amplify the impact of their ongoing research through direct\nengagement with the AGILE community, get new ideas, seek feedback about\ncurrent preliminary results and share experience about the PhD journey.\nWhere will take place?\nThe 7th edition of the AGILE PhD school will take place in Castellón de\nla Plana, Spain.
