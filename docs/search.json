Its goal is to provide a forum for PhD students to showcase\ntheir research progress, exchange ideas, engage in discussions on\ngeospatial methods, and enhance their geoinformatics-related skills.\nParticipation in the school will enable attendees to:\nBe exposed to the diversity of fields and common features of our\ndomain\nExchange ideas about the PhD process itself\nDevelop their network\nBe exposed to the reproducibility practices in the GIScience field.\nWhy to participate?\nAttending the AGILE PhD School offers a great opportunity for PhD\nstudents within the European GIScience community. Ideally for PhD\nstudents in their second year or nearing their dissertation. The school\naims to foster strong community academic connections, where participants\nwill benefit from valuable insights shared by former AGILE PhD School\nalumni.\nWe have prepared an agenda to not only enhance students’ scientific\nwriting skills but also deepen their understanding of GeoAI research.\nThe AGILE PhD school provides a platform for the students to amplify the\nimpact of their ongoing research through direct engagement with the\nAGILE community, get new ideas, and seek feedback about current\npreliminary results and share experiences about the PhD journey.\nWhere will it take place?\nThe 7th edition of the AGILE PhD school will take place in Castellón de\nla Plana, Spain. Situated between the beautiful Mediterranean Sea and\nthe stunning Sierra de Espadán mountains. The school will be hosted at\nthe University Jaume I, with the support of the Geospatial Research\nGroup - GeoTec. Submit your abstract and apply\nto be part of this AGILE PhD School edition.\n\nHow to apply\nTo join the AGILE PhD School 2024, participants are required to submit a\n300 to 500-word abstract summarising their ongoing research. The\nabstract may include preliminary results and highlight the relevance of\nyour work to the main topic of the AGILE PhD School: GeoAI for the\nSocial Good.\nSubmit your abstract to:\nFernando.Benitez@st-andrews.ac.uk.\nSubmission Deadline: August 27, 2024\nYour submission will be evaluated based on the clarity of your research,\nthe significance of your preliminary findings, and their potential\nimpact on the field of GeoAI.\nFormatting instructions\nAbstracts must be prepared using either the Word Document template or\nthe LaTeX Document template provided at\nhttps://www.agile-giscience-series.net/agile-giss-templates.html.\nAbstracts must be written in English according to the formatting\nguidelines. Note: Latex recommended editor: Overleaf.\nFinancial support\nFinancial assistance is available to the selected participants. While we\nwish we could cover all the related expenses, our budget is limited, and\nparticipants may be required to contribute.

In this talk, I will argue that to\ntransform this hype into sustainable and positive development, we\nneed to find ways to empower people to take control of their own\nassistive AI technology. To achieve this, spatial data science in\ngeneral, and mobility data science in particular, must up their\ngame and embrace open-source development and collaboration.\n\n10:00 - 11:00 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming:\nParticipants should form groups to brainstorm potential research\nquestions or projects using Geo AI and open-source tools, guided by\nthe insights from the keynote.\nEach group selects one research proposal/idea and outlines how to\nenhance it using the tools and methods discussed. Outcome required:\nDevelop a preliminary outline or draft of a potential journal paper,\nhighlighting the problem, Research Question, methodology, and expected\noutcomes.\nCoffee break\n11:30 - 13:30 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming,\nLunch at Restaurante Agora in campus\nAfternoon session\n15:00 - 16:00 - Keynote Speaker No 2 – Joao Porto de Albuquerque -\nProfessor in Urban Analytics (Urban Studies & Social Policy)\nUniversity of\nGlasgow\n\n16:00 - 18:00 - Post-Keynote Discussion and Brainstorming:\nContinuation of the morning brainstorming and drafting the paper\nidea based on the keynote speakers tools, methods and suggestions.\n20:00 - Dinner: TBD\nDay 4: Final presentations and closing remarks\nFriday, November 29th 2024\nFacilitators: Alina Ristea,\nHoda Bakhshi,\nDiego Pajarito,\nFernando Benitez-Paez\nMeeting room: TBD\nMorning session\n10:00 - 11:00 Open Science and Reproducibility – The Turing Way\nCoffee break\n11:30 - 13:00: Final Presentation and Feedback Session:\nBased on the previous brainstorming sessions, and the progress with the\ndrafted ideas, groups should prepare a brief presentation (max 3 slide)\nof their enhanced research proposal or draft journal paper, emphasizing\nthe use or integration of keynote speakers’ tools, methods or ideas.\n13:00 - 13:30 - Closing remarks\nLunch at Restaurante Agora in campus\nOrganising Commitee\nCarlos Granell - University Jaime I,\nSpain\nAlina Ristea - UCL, The\nUK\nHoda Bakhshi -\nUniversity of Zurich, Switzerland\nDiego Pajarito -\nUniversity of Glasgow, The UK\nFernando Benitez-Paez -\nUniversity of St Andrews, The UK\nSponsors\n\n\n\n\n",
